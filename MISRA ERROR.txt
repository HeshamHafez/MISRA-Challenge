I have to keep in one MISRA violation 

ERROR :(MISRA-C:2004 19.4/R) C macros shall only expand to a braced initialiser, a constant, a string literal, a parenthesised expression, a type qualifier, a storage class specifier, or a do-while-zero construct

this error because of stdlib.h library, and I need this library for rand() fuction.
